% GRAPHCUTS --- GraphCut segmentation example, description only
% CMP Vision Algorithms http://visionbook.felk.cvut.cz
%
% This section describes graph cut segmentation 
%  from a user perspective. Note that the
% implementation itself is not given here. First, we have
% finally hit the limit of Matlab abilities, a Matlab implementation
% would be unusably slow. Second, the algorithm is complicated and would
% take too much space here. Nevertheless, we consider graph cut  to be 
% sufficiently important to be presented here, although briefly.
% 
% {We will use a freely available implementation by O. Veksler, Y. Boykov,
% and V. Kolmogorov 
% with a Matlab wrapper written by Shai
% Bagon (http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/ bagon/matlab.html)
% that provides a GraphCut function. For usage information,
% install the wrapper and type help GraphCut in Matlab.}
